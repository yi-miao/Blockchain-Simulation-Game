# Blockchain-Simulation-Game
A simple game to help understanding of Blockchain 

# 🧱 Blockchain Simulation Game

A visual, interactive simulation that demonstrates how blockchain works — built with Python and Tkinter. This educational tool models wallet creation, peer-to-peer transactions, SYSTEM rewards, and block mining, all within a scrollable and zoomable GUI.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was designed to:
- Teach blockchain fundamentals through simulation
- Visualize transaction flow and block structure
- Explore concepts like mining, SYSTEM transactions, and wallet balances
- Serve as a foundation for gamified blockchain mechanics

## 🛠️ Features

- ✅ Wallet creation with unique addresses
- ✅ Peer-to-peer transactions with balance updates
- ✅ SYSTEM transactions for rewards or adjustments
- ✅ Block mining and chain extension
- ✅ Zoomable canvas with mouse wheel
- ✅ Auto-scroll to latest block
- ✅ Debug prints for transaction tracing

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Tkinter (included with standard Python)
- No external dependencies
